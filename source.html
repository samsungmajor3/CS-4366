    <br>
    (1) Load Management Use Case:<br>
    There are two functionalities for the workload management use case. <br>
    The team member will be able to view visualizations (data visualization) of the power consumption/power output along with functionality to throttle up or down the cluster operations (load management, power schedule, and power on/off). 
    <br>
    The call data functionality would be the API to call the data from the GLEAMM facility. 
    <br><br>

    (2) Stress-ng Use Case: <br>
    The Stress-ng use case is fairly straight forward.
    <br> A user wants to stress test one of three things, the memory, I/O systems, or the CPU load. 
    <br>
    The I/O systems and load extend the test CPU functionality.

    <br><br>

    (3) Load Management Class:<br>
    The main system controller class is the central component that manages and instantiates other objects to implement various functions.
    <br>
    When a user accesses the web application and logs in, the API is initialized, and it creates a call object to store API data. 
    <br>The controller, upon receiving API calls, instantiates solarVsTime, commercialUsage, and clusterUsage objects, which generate visual elements for the UI.
    <br>These objects are derived from the Visualization class, which stores graph data from the call object. 
    <br>Additionally, the controller initializes the management class, which, in turn, creates a schedule object to manage data and user-defined cluster throttle times. 
    <br>Finally, the UI includes a logout feature to allow users to log out of the system.
        <br><br>

    (4) Stress-ng Class:<br>
    The controller will the the main class in this system. 
    <br>When someone accesses the web-application, the controller instantiates a userInterface object which will take input from the user to indicate what the user would like to do.
    <br>If the user selects test CPU, and testCPU object is instantiated by the controller. 
    <br>If the user selects test memory, the controller instantiates a testMemory object, and so on.
    <br>The results of these tests will be sent back as output through the controller to the UI.
<br><br>

    (5) Load Management Sequence:<br>
    The system involves one actor, the GLEAMM User, and four key objects: User Interface (UI), Visualization, Proxy (API), and Management. 
    <br>The GLEAMM User interacts with the system via the UI, which presents data graphs, power levels, and scheduling options. 
    <br>The UI displays default graphs upon login and facilitates user input. 
    <br>Visualization is responsible for creating and displaying graphs. 
    <br>The Proxy (API) connects the GLEAMM facility clusters to the web UI, enabling remote data retrieval. 
    <br>Management empowers users to monitor power usage, availability, and schedule power usage rates.
    
    <br><br>

    (6) Stress-ng Sequence:<br>
    The user initiates the system by logging in and received a success message via the user interface. 
    <br>The user then decided if they want to test the CPU, memory, or I/O of the GLEAMM cluster. 
    <br>Based on the user’s input, the controller will initiate calls through the API to test one of those 3 stress-ng calls. 
    <br>When completed, the cluster will return the results of the test to the controller through the API. 
    <br>The controller will then send the results to the UI for the user to view. 
    <br>These stress-ng options remain until the user logs off. 
    
    <br><br>
    <h1 class="text-left">UI Prototype</h1>
   
    <br>
      The first thing the users sees will be the log-in page. 
    <br>It will require the users to sign in with their own e-Raider authentication information.
    <br>If they need an assistance with logging in, the assistance contact will take the users to the IT-help central homepage. 
          
<br><br>
Our home page will be the main dashboard of the web application. 
    <br>The users will be able to switch the pages by clicking the buttons on the left side of the page. 
    <br>The main dashboard will also show the users a graph of the power output of renewable energy VS the power consumption of the cluster over time. 
    <br>By showing this graph on the main page, the users will be able to see what is going with the cluster usage and stress-test the cluster or manage the workload of the cluster if necessary.

<br><br>
The Stress-ng page will contain all functions regarding the stress-testing of the cluster. 
    <br>The three functions we pick for this project are “I/O test”, “CPU workload test”, and “memory test”.
    <br>By clicking each button, they will be able to see the test result of the each test.

<br><br>
Workload Managemenet page will be for the workload management of the cluster. 
    <br>The user will be able to see a graph of the power output of renewable energy VS the power consumption of the cluster over time. 
    <br>The user will also be able to adjust the cluster power usage by the slider function on the left side of the page.
