                    <p class="lead my-4">The task is to set up and API into the GLEAMM cluster head node to support stress-ng functionality and to control the throttle on the cluster based on availability of renewable energy produced at the GLEAMM facility. 
                        The stress-ng C code will need to be wrapped in order for the API to support it. Such attempts have failed in the past due to pointers in C not being compatible with python. 
                        A web-interface for the stress-ng functions and to control the throttle on the GLEAMM cluster. 
                        The stress-ng interface will be used to test the cluster remotely instead of going to the facility in person and calling command line parameters because GLEAMM cluster is on its own private network. 
                        These tests will include throttling the cpu load, memory load, and I/O load.
                        <br>
                        Functionality of the web interface, other than connecting to the cluster via an API, includes sending stress-ng calls to the cluster for testing, ability to throttle the cluster operations based on available energy automatically and the ability to throttle the operations manually for various reasons. 
                        Scaled graphs have been requested to display power production vs power consumption of the cluster.
                        <br>
                        The speed of the API will depend on the needs of each facility based on its size. 
                        The larger the size, the less response time is needed from the API due to the build up of inertia in the system. 
                        For the GLEAMM facility, one call every fourteen seconds is sufficient.

    <h1 class="text-left">Interview1&2(Dr. Alan Sill & PHD Student Elham Hojati)</h1>

    <br>
    Q1. Could you provide additional details about the GLEAMM facility and the ongoing projects?
    <br>
    A1. GLEAMM stands for the Global Laboratory for Energy Asset Management and Manufacturing and currently the facility runs as a microgrid for our testing clusters. 
    <br>
    We take the different forms of energy to run the facility and clusters with those being solar, commercial electricity, battery units, and in the future, wind.
    <br>
    Our goal is to have efficient and smaller data centers that can run on renewable sources of energy and be self-sufficient to operate without the use of commercial power from the powerlines. 

    <br><br>

    Q2.How would our project be visualized or structured?
    <br>
    A2.Develop an API that encompasses the key functionalities of stress-ng. 
    <br>
    This API should empower a client, initially deployable on either the head node of the zephyr cluster or another node within the private network, to dynamically adjust CPU load. 
    <br>
    Optionally, it should provide capabilities for managing memory and I/O loads by invoking the C functions of the stress-ng code instead of relying on command-line usage.
    <br>
    This API will be integrated with data from the GLEAMM energy facility collected by Elham. 
    <br>
    The energy availability information will be used to dynamically modify the load on the cluster.
    <br>
    After this integration, additional functionalities will be incorporated to enable comprehensive control or balancing of power sources from the facility to the cluster. 
    <br>
    The primary goal is to ensure the continuous operation of the cluster. 
    <br>
    In scenarios such as cloudy weather, preventing the use of solar power, the cluster needs to autonomously determine the alternative power source to utilize.

<br><br>
    Q3.What types of energy sources do we need to take into account?
    <br>
    A3.We use solar, commercial electricity which comes from South Plains Electric Co-op that we pay by the kilowatt per hour for, we have battery banks, and we’re working on integrating wind energy from a turbine. 
    <br>
    For this project, you’ll only need to worry about the first 3, solar, commercial, and the batteries. 
    <br>
    We do have a diesel generator but we’ve used it less and less as we aim to have a low carbon footprint with the facility and any future similar facilities. 

<br><br>
    Q4.Considerations for the API implementation?
    <br>
    A4.Essentially you want to be able to communicate to the head node of the cluster which then will communicate to the other nodes so you want the client side to be on the head node. 
    <br>
    The PDU (power distribution unit) also has access to the head node so we can control the amount of nodes active through the head node. 
    <br>
    With this you can schedule power load balancing to efficiently have the cluster always running using the various forms of energy.

<br><br>
    Q5.How many data sets would we have to work with?
    <br>
    A5. We have lots of data sets but we can start with, let’s say 10. Once you reach the point for data, it can be provided to you.

    
<br><br>
    <h1 class="text-left">Interview3(Dr. Susan Mengel)</h1>
   
    <br>
    Q1.Can you share your experience collaborating with or alongside the GLEAMM team?
    <br>
    A1.I supervise a PhD student, Elham, who is tasked with gathering data from the GLEAMM facility cluster using dummy programs. 
    <br>
    Elham is conducting research using this data to develop a Machine Learning Model (MLM) aimed at managing the cluster and optimizing the use of green energy, thus reducing reliance on grid energy costs.
    <br>
    Additionally, another student, Aviral, worked on stress-ng, integrating a Python web interface. 
    <br>
    This allows Dr. Sill to remotely stress test the clusters without the need to personally visit the high-performance computing center, or in this case, the GLEAMM facility.

    <br><br>
    Q2.What are the ongoing projects that you are currently involved in or overseeing?
    <br>
    A2.As previously mentioned, I am overseeing Elham's project. 
    <br>
    Additionally, I am actively involved in assisting with a Machine Learning Model (MLM) designed to aid data scientists in examining and profiling their code to identify bottlenecks. 
    <br>
    Furthermore, I am overseeing a couple of other PhD students who are engaged in various projects.
    <br><br>
    Q3.What were the inquiries or requests made earlier regarding this project, and what were the outcomes?
    <br>
    A3.Aviral was tasked with making a web-interface for stress-ng as it was passed through command line and unix based. 
    <br>
    This web-interface would have taken the countless functions from stress-ng have them run through there instead of having to call from command line parameters. 
    <br> 
    By doing this, he had to find a way to enumerate all the functions in stress-ng using packages to the web interface. 
    <br>
    We had to come to just using OpenAPI to create a direct call to stessng from the web interface to send the variables but we had issues with this as a different package wouldn’t accept specific variables that used pointers. 
    <br>
    Python doesn’t handle pointers very well so when we tried to interface with that, it didn’t work very well. 
    <br>
    So he opted to create a python wrapper to have a few of the stress-ng commands be able to be run. 

    <br><br>
    Q4.What achieved success, what encountered failuares, and what recommendations can be provided?
    <br>
    A4.An idea would be to have an all command list.
    <br>
    Packages don't always work well so packages may not work in the wrapper as intended. 
    <br>
    Pointers were a big issue as we kept hitting walls, coming from C to Python as they’re a no-go in python. 

    
<br><br><br>
    <h1 class="text-left">Interview4(Dr. Argenis Bilbao)</h1>
   
    <br>
    Q1. How do you interpret this proposed project? 
    <br>
    A1.I comprehend this project as an API designed to manage the cluster by adjusting the workload as needed. 
    <br><br>
    Q2.We were assigned to interface with the API for stress-ng testing using a Python wrapper. 
    Would this be beneficial for your needs as well?
    <br>
    A2.Yes. That sounds like a great idea.

    <br><br>
    Q3.What data information are you able to contribute to this project?
    <br>
    A3. I can furnish details on power consumption, offering relevant insights for decision-making.
    Additionally, I will develop a compact API to access real-time power consumption information.
<br><br>
    Follow-up question: “What types of energy sources are currently in operation at GLEAMM?”
    <br>
    Currently, we rely solely on solar power but are also connected to commercial power. 
    Due to a battery system failure, there is no requirement to consider its integration into the project. 
    <br>
    We will supply data on solar energy generation and the cluster's consumption. 
    The objective is to adjust the cluster's capacity to align with power generation.
    <br><br>
    Q4.Would a gateway API be appropriate for this purpose?
    <br>
    A4.Certainly. The initial application should be directed to the head node. 
    <br>
    If everything checks out, subsequent integration with other nodes in the cluster can be accomplished seamlessly.
<br><br>
    Q5.What is the desired response time for this API? Our current proposal suggests a response interval of every 14 seconds.
    A5.That response interval would be suitable for regulating cluster operations. 
    <br>
    The optimal timeframe depends on the characteristics of the target system. 
    <br>
    Larger systems, with more inertia in the grid, require less response time for throttling back due to power buildup. 
    <br>
    In contrast, smaller systems with lower inertia necessitate a quicker response time.
<br><br>
    Q6.What features and functionalities would you prefer to have in a user interface?
    <br>
    A6.Make a scaled down version of solar energy graph which creates up to 150kW of power.
    <br>
    We want to scale this down by a factor, the consumption of the cluster is only 20kW, such that the max power output is 20kW based on cluster power use. 
    The power shed will follow generation.
    <br>
    From the GUI it would be nice to set the cluster such that the cluster uses 100% of the renewable energy. 
    <br>
    Also the ability to change the power consumption via a text box input such that we can tell it to use only 50% power because, say, a hospital needs to excess power during an emergency.
<br><br>
    Supplemental information from Dr. Bilbao:
    <br>
    Can read ERCOT data on the price of electricity, display it on the GUI,  and have the cluster operations updated. 
    <br>
    For example the price of power sometimes goes negative when there is overload in the grid. 
    <br>
    If we can track that and ramp up cluster operations when solar power is not being generated, we can operate for free without the renewable energy. 
    <br>
    This is already practiced by data centers. The cluster would ramp down once solar was available and/or the price increases.
