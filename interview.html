<h1>Interview Summary</h1>

<br><br>
   Interview1&2(Dr. Alan Sill & PHD Student Elham Hojati)
    <br>
    Q1. 
    <br>
    A1. 

    Q2.
    <br>
    A2.
    
<br><br>
   Interview3(Dr. Susan Mengel)
<br><br>
    
   Interview4(Dr. Argenis Bilbao)
    <br>
    Q1. How do you interpret this proposed project? 
    <br>
    A1.I comprehend this project as an API designed to manage the cluster by adjusting the workload as needed. 
    <br><br>
    Q2.We were assigned to interface with the API for stress-ng testing using a Python wrapper. 
    Would this be beneficial for your needs as well?
    <br>
    A2.Yes. That sounds like a great idea.

    <br><br>
    Q3.What data information are you able to contribute to this project?
    <br>
    A3. I can furnish details on power consumption, offering relevant insights for decision-making.
    Additionally, I will develop a compact API to access real-time power consumption information.
<br><br>
    Follow-up question: “What types of energy sources are currently in operation at GLEAMM?”
    <br>
    Currently, we rely solely on solar power but are also connected to commercial power. 
    Due to a battery system failure, there is no requirement to consider its integration into the project. 
    <br>
    We will supply data on solar energy generation and the cluster's consumption. 
    The objective is to adjust the cluster's capacity to align with power generation.
    <br><br>
    Q4.Would a gateway API be appropriate for this purpose?
    <br>
    A4.Certainly. The initial application should be directed to the head node. 
    <br>
    If everything checks out, subsequent integration with other nodes in the cluster can be accomplished seamlessly.
<br><br>
    Q5.What is the desired response time for this API? Our current proposal suggests a response interval of every 14 seconds.
    A5.That response interval would be suitable for regulating cluster operations. 
    <br>
    The optimal timeframe depends on the characteristics of the target system. 
    <br>
    Larger systems, with more inertia in the grid, require less response time for throttling back due to power buildup. 
    <br>
    In contrast, smaller systems with lower inertia necessitate a quicker response time.
<br><br>
    Q6.What features and functionalities would you prefer to have in a user interface?
    <br>
    A6.Make a scaled down version of solar energy graph which creates up to 150kW of power.
    <br>
    We want to scale this down by a factor, the consumption of the cluster is only 20kW, such that the max power output is 20kW based on cluster power use. 
    The power shed will follow generation.
    <br>
    From the GUI it would be nice to set the cluster such that the cluster uses 100% of the renewable energy. 
    <br>
    Also the ability to change the power consumption via a text box input such that we can tell it to use only 50% power because, say, a hospital needs to excess power during an emergency.
<br><br>
    Supplemental information from Dr. Bilbao:
    <br>
    Can read ERCOT data on the price of electricity, display it on the GUI,  and have the cluster operations updated. 
    <br>
    For example the price of power sometimes goes negative when there is overload in the grid. 
    <br>
    If we can track that and ramp up cluster operations when solar power is not being generated, we can operate for free without the renewable energy. 
    <br>
    This is already practiced by data centers. The cluster would ramp down once solar was available and/or the price increases.
