   Interview3(Dr. Susan Mengel)
    <br>
    Q1.Can you share your experience collaborating with or alongside the GLEAMM team?
    <br>
    A1.I supervise a PhD student, Elham, who is tasked with gathering data from the GLEAMM facility cluster using dummy programs. 
    <br>
    Elham is conducting research using this data to develop a Machine Learning Model (MLM) aimed at managing the cluster and optimizing the use of green energy, thus reducing reliance on grid energy costs.
    <br>
    Additionally, another student, Aviral, worked on stress-ng, integrating a Python web interface. 
    <br>
    This allows Dr. Sill to remotely stress test the clusters without the need to personally visit the high-performance computing center, or in this case, the GLEAMM facility.

    <br><br>
    Q2.What are the ongoing projects that you are currently involved in or overseeing?
    <br>
    A2.As previously mentioned, I am overseeing Elham's project. 
    <br>
    Additionally, I am actively involved in assisting with a Machine Learning Model (MLM) designed to aid data scientists in examining and profiling their code to identify bottlenecks. 
    <br>
    Furthermore, I am overseeing a couple of other PhD students who are engaged in various projects.
    <br><br>
    Q3.What were the inquiries or requests made earlier regarding this project, and what were the outcomes?
    <br>
    A3.Aviral was tasked with making a web-interface for stress-ng as it was passed through command line and unix based. 
    <br>
    This web-interface would have taken the countless functions from stress-ng have them run through there instead of having to call from command line parameters. 
    <br> 
    By doing this, he had to find a way to enumerate all the functions in stress-ng using packages to the web interface. 
    <br>
    We had to come to just using OpenAPI to create a direct call to stessng from the web interface to send the variables but we had issues with this as a different package wouldn’t accept specific variables that used pointers. 
    <br>
    Python doesn’t handle pointers very well so when we tried to interface with that, it didn’t work very well. 
    <br>
    So he opted to create a python wrapper to have a few of the stress-ng commands be able to be run. 

    <br><br>
    Q4.What achieved success, what encountered failuares, and what recommendations can be provided?
    <br>
    A4.An idea would be to have an all command list.
    <br>
    Packages don't always work well so packages may not work in the wrapper as intended. 
    <br>
    Pointers were a big issue as we kept hitting walls, coming from C to Python as they’re a no-go in python. 

    
<br><br><br>
    <h1 class="text-left">Interview4(Dr. Argenis Bilbao)</h1>
   
    <br>
    Q1. How do you interpret this proposed project? 
    <br>
    A1.I comprehend this project as an API designed to manage the cluster by adjusting the workload as needed. 
    <br><br>
    Q2.We were assigned to interface with the API for stress-ng testing using a Python wrapper. 
    Would this be beneficial for your needs as well?
    <br>
    A2.Yes. That sounds like a great idea.

    <br><br>
    Q3.What data information are you able to contribute to this project?
    <br>
    A3. I can furnish details on power consumption, offering relevant insights for decision-making.
    Additionally, I will develop a compact API to access real-time power consumption information.
<br><br>
    Follow-up question: “What types of energy sources are currently in operation at GLEAMM?”
    <br>
    Currently, we rely solely on solar power but are also connected to commercial power. 
    Due to a battery system failure, there is no requirement to consider its integration into the project. 
    <br>
    We will supply data on solar energy generation and the cluster's consumption. 
    The objective is to adjust the cluster's capacity to align with power generation.
    <br><br>
    Q4.Would a gateway API be appropriate for this purpose?
    <br>
    A4.Certainly. The initial application should be directed to the head node. 
    <br>
    If everything checks out, subsequent integration with other nodes in the cluster can be accomplished seamlessly.
<br><br>
    Q5.What is the desired response time for this API? Our current proposal suggests a response interval of every 14 seconds.
    A5.That response interval would be suitable for regulating cluster operations. 
    <br>
    The optimal timeframe depends on the characteristics of the target system. 
    <br>
    Larger systems, with more inertia in the grid, require less response time for throttling back due to power buildup. 
    <br>
    In contrast, smaller systems with lower inertia necessitate a quicker response time.
<br><br>
    Q6.What features and functionalities would you prefer to have in a user interface?
    <br>
    A6.Make a scaled down version of solar energy graph which creates up to 150kW of power.
    <br>
    We want to scale this down by a factor, the consumption of the cluster is only 20kW, such that the max power output is 20kW based on cluster power use. 
    The power shed will follow generation.
    <br>
    From the GUI it would be nice to set the cluster such that the cluster uses 100% of the renewable energy. 
    <br>
    Also the ability to change the power consumption via a text box input such that we can tell it to use only 50% power because, say, a hospital needs to excess power during an emergency.
<br><br>
    Supplemental information from Dr. Bilbao:
    <br>
    Can read ERCOT data on the price of electricity, display it on the GUI,  and have the cluster operations updated. 
    <br>
    For example the price of power sometimes goes negative when there is overload in the grid. 
    <br>
    If we can track that and ramp up cluster operations when solar power is not being generated, we can operate for free without the renewable energy. 
    <br>
    This is already practiced by data centers. The cluster would ramp down once solar was available and/or the price increases.
